===========================================
 Making use of mpop: the :mod:`pp` package
===========================================

The :mod:`pp` package is the heart of mpop: here are defined the core classes
which the user will need to build satellite composites.

Conventions about satellite names
=================================

Throughout the document, we will use the following conventions: 
* *satellite name* will designate the name of the platform, e.g. "noaa" in
   satellite "noaa 19"
* *satellite number* will refer to the number of the satellite in the series,
   e.g. "19" for satellite "noaa 19"
* *variant* will be used to differentiate the same data (from the same
   satellite and instrument) coming in different flavours. For example, we use
   variant to distinguish data coming from the satellite metop 02 from direct
   readout, regional coverage or global coverage.
